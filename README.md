### Project Title:
**How to write commit messages properly after learning to read directions**
It's a working title...

### Description:
This project is the final step before I get my Nanodegree from Udacity. I'm thrilled to be closing in on my goal.

### Files used:
None except the city bike share files, which are not available here. 
The CSV files are used to create the DF objects in the Python script.
